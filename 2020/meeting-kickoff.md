Date or time? I'm available on any day. As for time, I'm in CST (04:45 as I post this), and rather not start earlier than 09:00. That said, I'm the outlier here when it comes to timing, and I'm happy to join the group :)

@**all** its friday already and no one is sharing their availability for next week

we should get going by next week

sorry, just did

@**TheCharlatan** on IRC to me: "Both days suit me :)" for Monday and Tuesday.

@**Kayaba** if any of the other times better suits you, we let u chose

It seems like everyone works well with Monday 17:00 :)

done, we meet then, on Monday 17:00

i will share our call with comit people -- and point out to them the licensing discussion specifically, if no objections i will do so during the mrl meeting

during the call we said we would comment on the rfcs in zulip, but im not convinced its the best place, since the RFCs will be in the github repo. another option is to have one github issue per rfc, and have discussions there, what do you guys think?

IMO using github issue lesser the threshold for commenting and group at the same place the content and the discussion. I'm for using github issues
